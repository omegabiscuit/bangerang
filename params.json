Feel free to message me concerning any questions you may have!\r\n\r\n## [World of Warcraft Soundboard](https://github.com/omegabiscuit/WowSoundboard.git)\r\nThis was my first android app. I created it to help teach myself java and programming for android devices in general. The art for the app was created by Kyrsten Carlson.\r\n\r\n\r\n## [Scrabble Solver](https://github.com/omegabiscuit/IGN_Scrabble.git)\r\nA program that finds the best Scrabble word from a list of letters. It currently uses a word file with  a list of letters as the database. In future renditions of this program I want to implement an API from Dictionary.com so the program can have a larger database of words to choose from!\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nYou can contact me via email at bbangerter829@gmail.com at any time\r\n",
