 Welcome to My Page!
So this is a work in progress, but any apps I work on in the future can be accessed through this site. Feel free to message me concerning any questions you may have!

## [World of Warcraft Soundboard](https://github.com/omegabiscuit/WowSoundboard.git)
This was my first android app. I created it to help teach myself java and programming for android devices in general. The art for the app was created by Kyrsten Carlson.


## [Scrabble Solver](https://github.com/omegabiscuit/IGN_Scrabble.git)
A program that finds the best Scrabble word from a list of letters. It currently uses a word file with  a list of letters as the database. In future renditions of this program I want to implement an API from Dictionary.com so the program can have a larger database of words to choose from!
